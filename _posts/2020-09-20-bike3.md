description: "This lightweight supersport gets a whole new MotoGP-inspired look that makes it the most radical 300 on the street... or track. Its sleek new bodywork echoes Rossi’s race bike – and the aggressive new dual LED headlights underline its pure R-series DNA.

New high-specification 37mm inverted front forks offer enhanced suspension feel and feedback – while a lower fuel tank and revised handlebar position improve rider ergonomics to give you greater comfort and control.

Step up to the plate, and enter R-World."
