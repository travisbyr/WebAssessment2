| I created the webpages in the Jekyll layout folder. These pages contain the content for each webpage. The purpose of these webpages is to add the content from the Jekyll includes folder.<img src="https://github.com/NMIT-GITHUB/web503-assessment-two-travisbyr/blob/master/journalImages/1.png"> | In my layout folder, I have 5 pages which are the pages of the website. In these pages contain a line of code, that add a file from the includes folder. Each page in the layouts folder, iss used to build the website by adding content from the includes folder. | Jekyll automatically creates a layout folder. In this folder all I need to do is create each page and add the appropriate content from the includes folder. <img src="https://github.com/NMIT-GITHUB/web503-assessment-two-travisbyr/blob/master/journalImages/2.png"> |
| I created files containing the content of each product for the product list page in the Jekyll posts folder. An independent page is created for each product, containing the information and details of the product. <img src="https://github.com/NMIT-GITHUB/web503-assessment-two-travisbyr/blob/master/journalImages/3.png"> | In my posts folder, I have 3 example posts created. Each posts contains variables which are used to link with each product post. <img src="https://github.com/NMIT-GITHUB/web503-assessment-two-travisbyr/blob/master/journalImages/4.png"> | I created a jekyll post folder, and linked it to the product list. If their are more than 1 posts in the folder, jekyll will create more flex box elements to show the products without the need of repeating code. |
| I created indepedent files for each section of code in the Jekyll includes folder. This folder contains sections of code, such as the page header and footer.<br /> <img src="https://github.com/NMIT-GITHUB/web503-assessment-two-travisbyr/blob/master/journalImages/5.png"> | The reason I created seperate files for each section of code was to reduce the amount of code that needs to be duplicated. For example, every page is using the same footer. This means I can re-use the same section without duplicating code. | By setting up my code in this manner, multiple people are able to edit and create their own code without editing the main document and making changes. |
| I created a CNAME file, to setup a custom domain for the Jekyll website. | While creating this, I had some difficulty setting it up as I was unsure of how to set up the folder correctly. Although after some playing around I was able to figure out how to set it up correctly. | <img src="https://github.com/NMIT-GITHUB/web503-assessment-two-travisbyr/blob/master/journalImages/6.png"> |
| I created a Jekyll config file which is used to create custom variables. I created variables such as 'author' and 'description' so that I can minimise the amount of code that would be duplicated. This method allows me to only edit one line of code. <img src="https://github.com/NMIT-GITHUB/web503-assessment-two-travisbyr/blob/master/journalImages/8.png"> | For example, I changed the description of the website, I would not need to make the change on every page. As the website description is a variable, if I change the variable then the variable will change for every webpage.  <img src="https://github.com/NMIT-GITHUB/web503-assessment-two-travisbyr/blob/master/journalImages/7.png"> | Jekyll has this feature where you can create custom variables on a config.yml file. These variables can then be used accross the entire jekyll website. |
| I created a custom domain on 'openhost' and linked it with my Jekyll website. <img src="https://github.com/NMIT-GITHUB/web503-assessment-two-travisbyr/blob/master/journalImages/9.png"> | I had some difficulty setting up the DNS settings correctly to allow my domain to link with my Jekyll website. I also had an issue where I was unable to access the settings of the repository as I was not the primary owner of the repository. Because of this I needed to manually setup my Jekyll website with a custom domain. | After playing around with the DNS settings and GitHub repository I was able to successfuly setup my custom domain with my Jekyll website. |
